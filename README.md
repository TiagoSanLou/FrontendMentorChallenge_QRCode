**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

My takaway from this challenge is using flexbox to center and aling elements. Other than that, I basically execised twaking styling elements (font styles, padding, margins) to match the proposed design.

### Continued development

Further reading on flexbox documentation and other layout methods.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - This gave me the cleanest solution I could find.

- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This seems like a good starting point to understand flexbox.
